                    <p>It is an inevitable fact that capitalism has destroyed humanity, and even our planet. This article tells about Capitalism which has prospered over the centuries by exploiting nature, either as an “inexhaustible” supply of resources to produce commodities, or as a dumping ground for waste. But the earth's ability to endure the destructive processes of capital is reaching its limits.</p>
                    <p>We are referring to the fact that there is a broad scientific consensus that climate change is associated with a dizzying increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities. But the problem is not human activity in general. The problem is the activity carried out in the capitalist mode of production. Since 1880, the average temperature on Earth's surface has increased by almost 1 degree Celsius, according to different investigative bodies. The increase in global average temperature began during the Industrial Revolution and accelerated in the neoliberal era.</p>
                    <p>It is very interesting to pay attention to the presentation of statements in this article which I think are very reasonable to be realized, namely Many scientists, environmentalists, international organizations and even major media characterize the current moment as one of the "crisis of civilization". In the face of this prophesied catastrophe, capitalist ideology sows fear, which underlies security policies and individual solutions. The ecological crisis requires that communism is championed as the only perspective for the salvation of mankind and the planet. The fundamental issue is whether adaptation to climate change will be in the hands of capital or the basis of the marginalized majority of society. In this struggle, the working class must position itself as a hegemonic subject, taking on environmental demands. This is an indispensable prerequisite for building a system based on solidarity. This will at the same time end poverty and social inequality. That rearranges production in a way that respects natural cycles without depleting our resources.</p>
                    <p>We must understand that we do not see socialism - communism from their dark history. But how do they build community solidarity in solving common problems in a social group.</p>
                    <p>It is time for the world to realize that CAPITALISM DESTROYS US ALL. It is time for us to rise up and FIGHT.</p>
