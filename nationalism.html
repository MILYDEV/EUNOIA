                    <p>Today I read an article by George Orwell about "nationalism", where some people see nationalism as an ideology, and others see it simply as an obsession with the existence of a nation's communal identity. I agree with George Orwell's opinion on nationalism which I quoted from his writings in the article.</p>
                    <p>George Orwell begins his essay "A Note on Nationalism" by admitting that nationalism is not the right word, but is an approximate term for what he wants to discuss. He explains:</p>
                    <p>What I mean by “nationalism” is first of all the habit of assuming that humans can be classified like insects and that entire blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labeled “good” or “bad”. But second—and this is far more important—I mean the habit of identifying oneself with one nation or another unit, placing it beyond good and evil and acknowledging no duty other than advancing its interests.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere he described nationalism more simply as "a crazy modern habit of identifying with a unit of great power and seeing everything in terms of competitive prestige." Orwell lists three "main characteristics of nationalist thought" which include:</p>
                    <p>First, Obsession. As close as possible, no nationalist has ever thought, spoken, or written about anything but the superiority of his own unit of power.</p>
                    <p>Second, the content of nationalist beliefs, and even the object of their devotion, can change according to circumstances. "What remains constant in the nationalist is his own state of mind" a relentless, reductive, uncompromising spirit. The point is to keep yourself always in a state of frenzy about contests of vicarious honor, whether engaging in a spasm of anger over perceived humiliation or in sadistic ecstasy celebrating some new victory. It is the intensity of the single thought that matters, not the real cause.</p>
                    <p>And third, Nationalists instinctively achieve the kind of dual thinking that Airstrip One residents instill with conscious effort: “Nationalism is a thirst for power wrought by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most blatant dishonesty, but he also because he is conscious of serving something greater than himself firmly believes he is in the right.” His fundamental belief, he felt sure, must be true; therefore, the facts must be made to conform to it.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, I support Orwell's statement about nationalism. I come from a country that adheres to nationalism. We must look at something not from the doctrine or teachings of the educational curriculum alone. We have to look at things/phenomena from a different perspective.</p>
                    <p>Before continuing I want to make a little note, that we view everything on the basis of truth. We need to know that the truth is divided into 2 versions (according to) my opinion. That is something that is proven by facts without any doctrine and interests of a party, and the fact is true, then it is the truth. And there are also those where the truth is adopted by the basic norms of a society which views something that has become a hereditary tradition and is very common, then it is the truth for them, even though it is beyond reason.</p>
                    <p>Similar to nationalism, nationalism can be seen as right for a community because it is in the name of honor and racial equality or reflects a communal identity. But if viewed from another perspective, nationalism can be dangerous because nationalism is not much different from a rebellious movement of radicals who want freedom for themselves, and form an order according to their own wishes.</p>
