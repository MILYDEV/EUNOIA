                    <p>From the 7 pages I read, I caught the following information... It's all about how the working class or proletariat fights for their rights by attacking the nobility and the bourgeoisie with criticism and humor that directly satirizes their actions (the bourgeoisie and the landlords).</p>
                    <p>The landlords and bourgeois bastards always look down on the lower classes and don't appreciate the work of the proletariat. They rooted their industry throughout the country, but seemed to cover up the cries of the beggars, the poor, and the hard workers who drained their energy for the morsel of food to feed their families.</p>
                    <p>This is just a small conclusion from me. Not a form of eunoia or a very deep philosophy. Only reading about how difficult the life of the lower middle class. Just a reading that will open your view about the hardships of the life of the workers under the auspices of capitalism and the selfishness of the owners of capital or landlords.</p>
                    <p>WE MUST LEARN FROM THE PAST!</p>
